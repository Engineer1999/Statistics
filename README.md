# Statistics

In this repository I explore statistical concepts and certain exercises using [python](https://www.python.org). 
My objective is to breakdown concepts in such a way that readers with high school knowledge of math/stats can easily follow along and learn something useful.

## System Requirements

You will need python 3.x and the following packages:
- numpy
- pandas
- scipy
- matplotlib
- statsmodels

Almost all scripts are presented in [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) format.

## Statistical Significance

In a medium article on [statistical significance](https://medium.com/@nadimkawwa/follow-learn-statistical-significance-with-python-6d31c8d0c744) we explore how to determine if your results are significant. We will need to explore both the invariant and the evaluation metrics

## Experiment Size

Practical significance is another topic for statisticians to consider. Can your experiment be done in the real world? This is covered in this [medium article](https://medium.com/@nadimkawwa/follow-learn-experiment-size-with-python-7651251e027b).

## German Tanks, Sticks, and Dice

In this part we go over three statistical questions and how to solve them in python. The flow is as follows:

- State the problem
- Set up the experiment
- Implement in  code
- Validate result analytically
